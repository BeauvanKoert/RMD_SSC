# RMD_SSC
This repository contains code used for collecting, processing, and analyzing SSC and SR data for the Rhine Meuse Delta (RMD).
All used scripts and output files are included, except for:
1) The Landsat SR data over the RMD ("LC02_Polygons_Reach_ID.csv"), since Github does not support a filesize of 1.49GB)
2) The Landsat SR data at stations WITH 1-day date buffer and all band ratios calculated ("LC02_matchup_1DAY.csv", 30.7MB)
